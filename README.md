# Big-data-project
This jupyternote book demonstrated my skillset in data exploration, data cleaning/mining and visualization using python. The dataset  contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle, Washington. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. I was able to use Pandas and Matlab in this.





Another project on Iris dataset, The mission was to evaluate KNN, Naive Bayes and logistic classifier and model performances using the dataset. This session demonstrated my knowledge and execution on Machine learning, Sklearn, confusion matrix etc.
